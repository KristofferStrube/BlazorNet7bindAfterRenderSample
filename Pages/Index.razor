To replicate the many renders open the console so that you can see the messages. Then edit the input, remove focus from the input and wait 4 seconds for the <code>bind:after</code> Asynchronous Task to be done.
<br />
<br />
What we expect is for there to be at most 1 render after the Asynchronous Task is done. What we actually see is that it renders 3 times.
<br />
<br />

<input @bind=@_myText @bind:after="AsynchronousTask" />

@code {
    private string _myText = "Start Value";

    private async Task AsynchronousTask()
    {
        await Task.Delay(4000);
    }

    protected override void OnAfterRender(bool firstRender)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("rendered!");
    }
}
